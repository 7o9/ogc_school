Folder Organization and File Names 
===================================

- Each standard has its own Folder
- Each folder for each standard contains two folders: **slides** and **img**
- The reference location of the images is relative to the build folder. So to insert an image from the cat/img the following must be done::
	.. image:: ../cat/img/metadataaboutdata.jpg
- Each file extension is .rst
- Each file should contain language code at the end of the file name. For example for wms in protugese wms_pt.rst. ISO 2 letter language codes shold be used: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes
