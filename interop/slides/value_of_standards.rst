Why Open Standards?
-------------------


- Prevents a single, self-interested party from controlling a standard
- Lower systems and life cycle costs
- Encourage market competition: Choose based on functionality desired and avoid “lock in” to a proprietary solution
- Stimulates innovation beyond the standard by companies that seek to differentiate themselves.

Location Interoperability
-------------------------

.. class:: big
   
   Defined as the ability of diverse data sources, systems and organizations to work together (inter-operate).

Location Interoperability
-------------------------

- Ease information sharing
- Promote information reuse
- Reduce duplication of effort
- Flexibility to add new capabilities
- Vendor neutral
- Saves time, reduces cost, increases market choice, protects assets and lives

Location Interoperability Challenge
-----------------------------------
Ability to access, fuse and apply diverse content when and where needed is critical to situational awareness and disaster planning/ response in cross-boundary and cross-domain settings
