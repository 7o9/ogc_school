**Mission**: To serve as a global forum for the collaboration of developers and users of spatial data products and services, and to advance the development of international standards for geospatial interoperability.

What does the OGC as an entity provides?
----------------------------------------
- An agreed upon **consensus process**
   - to encourage effectiveness and efficiency
   - for defining, testing, documenting, and approving specifications
- **Staff knowledge, expertise and support** to work with the members to facilitate the consensus process
- A comprehensive **communications infrastructure**
- A **consensus-based forum** for conflict resolution

.. Geospatial Interoperability to dictionary is our mission and our expertise.  OGC has alliances with other major standards and professional organizations to assure that geospatial interoperability is consistently addressed across the broader IT community.  There is a growing body of internet standards that employ OGC standards (such as OGC Geography Markup Language) to consistently define  and address “location” across the internet and wireless.
