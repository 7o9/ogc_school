.. Geospatial Interoperability to dictionary is our mission and our expertise.  OGC has alliances with other major standards and professional organizations to assure that geospatial interoperability is consistently addressed across the broader IT community.  There is a growing body of internet standards that employ OGC standards (such as OGC Geography Markup Language) to consistently define  and address “location” across the internet and wireless.
