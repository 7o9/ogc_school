The OGC Standards Development Program
=====================================

It's all about coordinating people

   “Interoperability seems to be about the integration of information.  What it’s really about is the coordination of organizational behavior.”

    *David Schell, OGC Founder*


Standards Development Program
-----------------------------
- Consensus standards process similar to other Industry consortia (World Wide
  Web Consortium, OMA etc.).
- 33 “core” standards
- 15 extensions/profiles

What is a standard?
-------------------
- A **document**, established by **consensus** and **approved** by the OGC
  Membership, that provides rules and guidelines, aimed at the optimum degree
  of interoperability in a given context.
- Conveys:
   - Community requirements
   - Member requirements
   - Market trends
   - Technology trends

Type of Specifications
----------------------
Implementation Specifications - Standards
   Basis for working software; detail the interface structure between software components
Abstract Specifications
   Conceptual foundation / reference model for specification development
Best Practices
   Describe use of specifications
Engineering Reports
   Results from the OGC Interoperability Program
Discussion Papers
   Forum for public review of concepts


What it takes
-------------

- Requires collaboration on a global basis
- Requires concensus by many organizations
- Requires give and take
- Requires certified, repeatable process

The Core of Consensus Philosophy

.. OGC has 4 F2F meeting per year, Most WGS meet very week.

Consensus decision-making
-------------------------

**Is a group decision making process that seeks the consent of all participants. Consensus may be defined professionally as an acceptable resolution, one that can be supported, even if not the "favourite" of each individual.**

- This is what the OGC standards process is all about!
- Guided by the TC Policies and Procedures
- Also documented in the TAO: A Guide for New Members, the OGC New Member Orientation, and numerous other documents.
- Also guided by the OGC Principals of Conduct

Technical Committee
-------------------

- Where the formal standards development consensus discussion and approval process occurs.
- Comprised of a number of Domain Working Groups (DWGs or WGs for short) and Standards Working Groups (SWGs).
- Work guided by the Technical Committee Policies and Procedures

Domain Working Groups (DWGs)
----------------------------
Where Members discuss technical requirements, use cases, and issues related to the development and revision of OGC standards. The results of OGC interoperability projects are presented and discussed. Many Member presentations on the use of OGC standards.
Any Member or invited guest can attend any DWG session.


3D Information Management DWG
-----------------------------
Interoperation across the AEC / CAD / Geospatial domains

- 3D City Models
- 3D Visualization and Portrayal Services
- Location Services
- Indoor Location / Navigation
- CityGML Discussions

Aviation DWG
------------
Develop and test standards-based service-oriented architecture to support the provision of valuable aeronautical information directly to flight decks and Electronic Flight Bags (EFB)

Business Value DWG
------------------

Engage senior managers, commercial, sales and marketing professionals from the OGC membership in activities to identify, organize and promote the business value of OGC standards. 

Coverages
---------
Promote and oversee development of OGC Implementation Specifications for exploitation of, and accessing, coverage data, including images and other grid coverages. Secondary purposes include promoting use of these specifications, and refining the OGC Abstract Specification as may be needed to better support these specifications.

Workflow
--------
A forum for describing, discussing, and solving any issues related to geospatial workflows. By geospatial workflow we mean any workflows that contain any or all processes that relate to geospatial processes and/or data. The primary focus of this DWG is to help individuals and organizations to identify smarter, easier, and more economical ways to build, migrate, manage, and maintain workflows.




Business Intelligence and Decision Support
------------------------------------------

Discuss requirements for interfaces necessary for interoperable service chaining (common expression and execution) in the areas of data mining, Integrated Client to access all OWS services and simulation. The DS DWG is currently reworking its mission to better reflect current OGC and IT best practices with regard to decision support.

Defence and Intelligence DWG
----------------------------
Real time access, integration, and fusion of static and real time assets for counter-terrorism, in support of the Warfighter, and other command and control operations


Earth System Science (ESS) DWG
------------------------------

Coordination point for multiple DWGs working geosciences, environmental, and other activities related to the use of OGC standards

Very recent: GeoSciML Discussions


Energy and Utilities DWG
------------------------

Focus on the global energy and utilities community, which is defined as individuals and organizations engaged in the geospatial aspects of the planning, delivery, operations, reliability and ongoing management of electric, gas, oil and water services throughout the world.

Geosemantics
------------

The mission of the Geosemantics DWG to establish an interoperable and actionable semantic framework for representing the geospatial knowledge domains of information communities as well as mediating between them.


Land Development and Infrastructure DWG
---------------------------------------
Assess the feasibility of moving the LandXML Schema into LandGML. Engage the existing LandXML user community to identify current satisfaction with the schema and to understand desired enhancements. Develop a demonstration project to test the proposed strategy.
Goal: Open Civil and Survey Data Exchange

Law Enforcement and Public Safety (LEAPS) Domain Working Group
--------------------------------------------------------------


Forum for uniting communities of users including government agencies, industry, research organizations, non-governmental organizations and others. Promotes dialog, collaboration and innovation concerning interoperability and standards harmonization within the LEAPS community. 


Location Services and Mass Market Domain Working Group
------------------------------------------------------
- Navigation
- GeoPackage
- KML
- Mobile – GeoSMS
- Moving Features

Met/Oceans DWG
--------------

Enables collaboration and communication between groups with meteorological and oceanographic interests. Maintains a list of topics of interest to the meteorological and oceanographic communities for discussion, defining feedback to the OGC SWGs, and performing interoperability experiments.

What is the OGC Planning Committee?
-----------------------------------
- The Planning Committee provides guidance and the management structure for the Technical Committee and the Interoperability Program.
- Members participate in OGC business planning and market focus activities
- Manages the consortium’s technology release process
- Approves special negotiated memberships and committee participation.
- Must be a Principal or Strategic Member or a TC representative to the PC to participate in PC activities.


What is the OGC Architecture Board (OAB)?
-----------------------------------------
- Work with the TC and the PC to insure architecture consistency of the Baseline and provide guidance to the OGC membership to insure strong life cycle management of the OGC standards baseline
- Reviews all OGC standards and revisions to standards prior to public comment.
- General technology discussions and guidance
- Evaluate candidate standards for fast track process
- Issue resolution
- Nominated and Elected by the OGC Membership
