Interoperability Program (IP)
-----------------------------

- A global, innovative, hands-on rapid prototyping and testing program
  designed to unite users and industry in accelerating interface development
  and validation, and the delivery of interoperability to the market.
- 70 initiatives since 1999
- Deliverables:
   - Technical Documents
   - Prototype Implementations
   - Demonstrations



Benefits of Involvement in IP Initiatives
-----------------------------------------

For Participants
    - Early insights and skill building
    - Early visibility
    - Early market deployment
    - Direct influence
    - Broaden market reach

Benefits of Involvement in IP Initiatives
-----------------------------------------
For Sponsors
    - Ability to Determine Market Interest
    - Accelerated process - workable interface specifications in 4-6 months
    - Vendors test, validate and demonstrate interface integrity – Rapid
      time to market
    - Leverage of other sponsor’ funding to solve common/similar problems
    - Significant ROI 2-3.5 overall (and as high as 25 for individual
      sponsors)

IP Type of activities
---------------------
- **Testbeds**: provide an environment for collaborative, fast-paced, multi-vendor
  rapid prototyping efforts to define, design, develop, and test candidate
  interface and encoding specifications.
- **Pilots**: apply and test OGC standards in real world applications using
  standards-based commercial off-the-shelf (SCOTS) products that implement OGC
  standards. Pilot Projects also help organizations identify gaps to be
  addressed by further standards development work.
- **Interoperability Experiments**
- **Concept Development Studies**
- **Plugest**
